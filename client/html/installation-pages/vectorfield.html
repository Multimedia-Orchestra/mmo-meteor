        I wanted to create something that would make people physically moving to interact with the sketch. I wanted to give people a superpower feeling, like they could manipulate space far away from their physical bodies. This is a constraint that I feel humans are constantly trying to overcome. I also believe in the power of physical movement to connect strangers.

        I love vector fields - they're just the right combination of math and art. They give a clear and succinct representation of the dynamics of a system in an elegant visual format.

        <!-- But there was a new problem with transparent particles &#45; it was too black. Most of the space felt empty, with only a few stray bits of grey. It felt lonely. So, why not bump up the particle count? Because it was slow. Keeping 60 fps is extremely important for sketches like this, where the user expects *immediate* feedback from their interactions. The solution was to performance tune the sketch. -->
