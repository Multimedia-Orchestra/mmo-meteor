<p>
I wanted to create something that would make people physically moving to interact with the sketch. I wanted to give people a superpower feeling, like they could manipulate space far away from their physical bodies. This is a constraint that I feel humans are constantly trying to overcome. I also believe in the power of physical movement to connect strangers.
