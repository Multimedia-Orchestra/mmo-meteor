The visualizer instrument I built is a human-controlled visualizer for music. It used flat shapes and repetition, and it was made as an experiment in adding a human element to music visualization. The controls were mapped to a normal computer keyboard, a mouse, and a LeapMotion device. It was built in Processing. An ideal next iteration would have more complex graphics and a greater number of gestural controls.
